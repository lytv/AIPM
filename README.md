## 1. Executive Summary
This learning path is designed to leverage your existing technical and AI strengths while filling the gaps in business strategy, user psychology, and product discovery. As an engineer, you already understand *feasibility*; the goal is to master *desirability* (user needs) and *viability* (business value).

**Your Unfair Advantage**:
*   Deep understanding of ML capabilities and constraints.
*   Ability to communicate effectively with engineering teams.
*   "Technical Product Manager" (TPM) or "AI Product Manager" roles often pay a **20-25% premium**.

## 2. Prerequisites & Foundation
*   **Mindset Shift**: Move from "How do I build this?" to "Should we build this, and why?"
*   **Core Reading**: *Inspired* by Marty Cagan (The Bible of PM).
