## 🛠️ Core PM Frameworks & AI Relevance

| Framework | Core Concept | AI Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RICE** | Prioritization: **R**each, **I**mpact, **C**onfidence, **E**ffort. | AI can predict "Impact" and refine "Reach" estimates based on data. "A-RICE" is a variant for AI initiatives. |
| **MoSCoW** | Requirements: **M**ust, **S**hould, **C**ould, **W**on't. | AI helps process large datasets/feedback to categorize requirements automatically. |
| **JTBD** | **J**obs **T**o **B**e **D**one: Focus on user goals/outcomes. | Critical for AI: "Hiring" AI to automate tasks or generate content. |
| **North Star** | Single metric aligning long-term success. | AI products often use specific North Stars (e.g., "automated resolution rate"). |
| **CIRCLES** | Design Interview: **C**omprehend, **I**dentify, **R**eport, **C**ut, **L**ist, **E**valuate, **S**ummarize. | Standard for interviews; AI adds new constraints/opportunities in the "List Solutions" phase. |
