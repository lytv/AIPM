# Plan: Parallel Translation for "Continuous Discovery Habits"

## 1. Analysis of Source Material
- **File**: `/Users/mac/tools/AIPM/ebooks/Continuous Discovery Habits PDF.pdf`
- **Type**: Summary/Bookey version (approx. 97 pages).
- **Structure**: 7 Chapters.
    - Ch 1: The What and Why
    - Ch 2: Common Framework
    - Ch 3: Outcomes Over Outputs
    - Ch 4: Discovering Opportunities
    - Ch 5: Discovering Solutions
    - Ch 6: Start Small, Iterate
    - Ch 7: What's Next?

## 2. Parallel Processing Strategy
To maximize speed as requested, we will launch **3 parallel agents** to process different sections of the book simultaneously.

### Agent 1: Foundations & Outcomes
- **Scope**: Chapters 1, 2, 3.
- **Focus**: Continuous Discovery definition, Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) intro, Outcome-based mindset.

### Agent 2: The Core Framework (Discovery)
- **Scope**: Chapters 4, 5.
- **Focus**: Experience mapping, Interviewing, Opportunity mapping, Ideation, Prototyping, Testing assumptions.

### Agent 3: Execution & Adoption
- **Scope**: Chapters 6, 7.
- **Focus**: Implementing in teams, Keystone habits, Continuous improvement.

## 3. Execution Steps
1.  **Create Directory**: `Continuous_Discovery_Habits_VN` to store outputs.
2.  **Launch Parallel Tasks**: Trigger 3 sub-agents with specific prompts to read their assigned pages/chapters and generate Markdown files (`Part_1.md`, `Part_2.md`, `Part_3.md`).
3.  **Consolidation**: Once all agents finish, review files and ensure consistency in terminology (e.g., *Opportunity Solution Tree, Outcome, Output*).

## 4. Output Format
- **Format**: Markdown.
- **Style**: Hybrid Study Guide (Summary + Detailed Translation + Glossary).
- **Terminology**: Keep English terms for key concepts (e.g., *Opportunity Solution Tree, Assumption Testing*).

## 5. Next Action
- Create the folder.
- Execute the parallel tasks immediately upon approval.
