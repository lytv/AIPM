## Tips for Success

### Daily Habits

2. **Morning Read + Evening Practice**: Tách biệt input và output
3. **Feynman Daily**: Explain 1 concept mỗi ngày (to yourself or others)
4. **Flashcard Review**: 20 cards/day, every day
5. **Real-world Application**: Áp dụng ít nhất 1 concept trong công việc mỗi tuần

### Weekly Rituals
1. **Sunday Planning**: Plan tuần tiếp theo
2. **Sunday Review**: Complete weekly review document
3. **Weekend Deep Work**: Mind mapping, case studies
4. **Biweekly Check-in**: Review progress với mentor/friend
5. **Monthly Retrospective**: What worked, what didn't

### Learning Accelerators
1. **Study Group**: Find PM learning buddies
2. **Teach Others**: Best way to master concepts
3. **Real Projects**: Apply to actual work immediately
4. **Ask Questions**: Join PM communities (Slack, LinkedIn)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. ❌ **Binge Reading**: Don't rush through chapters
